# A Save Tree for Divinity: Original Sin 2
I wanted a better way to organize my saves and figured git was a good way to do it. 

# How to use
## Add the profile to your game
Clone this repository into your save folder. This should be %USERFOLDER%\Documents\Larian Studios\Divinity Original Sin 2\PlayerProfiles\
Once this is done, you should find a profile called Orzo in game. Simply load it up and continue.

## Make commits and branch as necessary
The save game is in Honour Mode because this keeps the saves in a single file. To keep track of your own saves, simply save where you want to save, and then make a new commit or commit to a new branch.

## View your save tree
Use any Git Gui or use "git log --graph --all --oneline" to view the tree in console. Or even the github network view: https://github.com/Atheyon/Orzo/network

## No License? 
I do not pretend to know the ownership semantics of save game data. Therefore, this repository is freely available at your own risk.
